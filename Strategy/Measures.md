1. Calmar ratio

   **About**: 
   Calmar ratio (or Drawdown ratio) is a performance measurement used to evaluate Commodity Trading Advisors and hedge funds. The name of his ratio "Calmar" is an acronym of his company's name and its newsletter: CALifornia Managed Accounts Reports. The Calmar ratio changes gradually and serves to smooth out the overachievement and underachievement periods of a CTA's performance more readily than either the Sterling or Sharpe ratios. 
   
   **Definition**:
   The Calmar ratio uses a slightly modified Sterling ratio - average annual rate of return for the last 36 months divided by the maximum drawdown for the last 36 months - and calculates it on a monthly basis, instead of the Sterling ratio's yearly basis. 
   
   **Formular**:
   $\frac{36m compounded annual return}{36m maximum drawdown}$ 
   
   **code**:
   
      def calmar()
         pass
